A Play2 documentation renderer
=====================================

A quick and dirty (and buggy ?) app to navigate through the Play2 documentation hosted on the [Play2 Github repository](https://github.com/playframework/Play20/tree/master/documentation/manual)

Written using Play 2.1 RC1 with Scala (bad Scala actually since it is my first Scala code...).

Uses [[Pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/) for the markdown rendering.

Do not hesitate to submit a pull request of fill an issue for enhancements :-)
